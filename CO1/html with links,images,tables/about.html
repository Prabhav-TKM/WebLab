    <center>ABOUT THE COLLEGE
        <p><align= center>Reflecting a commendable legacy of more than 6 decades, TKM College of Engineering, situated in the cashew hub of Kerala, City of Kollam; is the first Government- aided engineering college in Kerala. It is ideally located, in Karikode, on the Kollam- Chenkotta road, about 5 kilometers from the heart of the city. The campus, a distinctive landmark that cuts above the rest is built in the aesthetic Indo Saracenic architectural style with mughal influence.

            The college is the first and foremost institution for technical education, run by the TKM College Trust, headed by Janab Shahal Hassan Musaliar. The foundation stone of the college was laid in the year 1956 by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the first President of Independent India. The college was formally inaugurated by Prof. Humayun Kabir, the then Minister for Scientific and Cultural Affairs, Govt. of India, on 3rd July, 1958.
            
            At its start, the college began its stride with the three basic branches of engineering â€“ Civil, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. Today it is a renowned technical institution in India, offering undergraduate programs in eight branches of engineering and architecture, ten postgraduate programs of different specializations in engineering and an MCA program. </align></p></hr>
